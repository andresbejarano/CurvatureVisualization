# CurvatureVisualization
A basic tool built using C++ and VTK for visualizing both Principal Curvatures and the Gaussian Curvature of parametrized meshes (cylinder, cone, ellipsoid and torus)

## Instructions
Use 1 - 4 keys for changing the solids:
1. Cylinder
2. Cone
3. Ellipsoid
4. Torus

After pressing the key then click on the window for applying the change (it is a silly bug).

## Requirements
The program requires [VTK](https://www.vtk.org/). Please download it, compile and install before running this program.
